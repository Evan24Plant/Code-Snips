# Code-Snips
A repo to be used as a collection of misc code snippets from various projects.

MyLevelUp
------
*CountingHelper.cs*

The main script used in the "Counting Game" for the MyLevelUp application, developed in Unity. I am wholey responsible for this version of the script, so it's a great example of my production-level coding style.

GameJam2019
------

A collection of code covering the enemy functionality that I was in charge of & created. *Messenger.cs* is the only publicly available file I imported for this part of the project.
